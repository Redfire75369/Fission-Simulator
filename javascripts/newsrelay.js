	["Scientists found out that nuclear reactors are more efficient than antimatter. Experts say the reason could be the explosions created by the antimatter made the measuring device broken beyond repair, resulting in the reading of 0.", true],
	["Martha! Why is there suddenly a reactor melting down in my backyard?", true],
	["People are complaining about radioactivity leaking from our site, Captain! Should I silence them?", true],
	["Colonel Rhdmskyh looked over the horizon. There was nothing abnormal happening. There were no nuclear explosions, no radioactive waste leaking out, only the beautiful skyline of the city of Yhwisirk. He did not expect for it to change so suddenly, as an experiment was interfered. “Colonel! The nuclear lab-” The messenger’s voice was quickly drowned out by a shattering just a few miles away. The silhouette of a mushroom cloud could be seen in the distance. “Colonel, you know the experiment with the nucleosynthesis thing? It was sabotaged.” The colonel froze. Sabotaged? It was the first time in millennia that the Universal Nucleosynthesis Experiment had been sabotaged. More distant explosions could be heard. “I shall attend a meeting with the council members on this matter immediately,” he proclaimed. And it was done. “Colonel Rhdmskyh Swasikova of legion 8e4 at celestial body 478-X3E, report on the situation at 478-X3E immediately.” “Instructions clear, O8-CXVI. The Universal Nucleosynthesis Experiment has been sabotaged. Current situation 58,976 dead, 890,578 injured. 5 facilities were destroyed.” An awkward silence followed. O8-LIV could be heard typing vigorously. “I have compiled a list of civilizations that don’t have the best relationship with us humans. The most likely suspect would be the zalgans. Colonel, I expect you to have your army on your way to celestial body 580-Z8L immediately.”", true],
	["Tensions between Ywisirk and Blotranka continue to rise. The leader of Blotranka threatens that “if Ywisirk continues to place a 100% tax rate on imported goods” Blotranka will “leak all their personal letters which spread the propaganda that fission reactors are real”. Ywisirk's foreign affairs department has yet to respond.", true],
	["Object#: PAO-2038 Object Class: <s>Safe</s> Keter Containment Procedures: PAO-2038 is to be kept in an air-tight room which should be kept as close to a true vacuum as possible. The room should be lined with at least 10 metres of lead and insulator, and with shock-absorbent materials. Description: PAO-2038 is a metal box with dimensions 40cmx40cmx10cm. <s>PAO-2038 appears to be completely harmless but processes some anomalous properties such as not being able to be bent nor broken</s> PAO-2038 is now considered Keter class after incident 2038-1. PAO gained a white glow and converted the surrounding matter into explodium-357. It subsequently created neutrons which lead the explodium to fission, destroying most of Site-394. No more further sightings of the event have been noticed.", true],
