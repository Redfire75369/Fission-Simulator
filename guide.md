# Guide

## Mines
- Mines are producers which produce fuel/second depending on their quantity and multiplier

## Reactors
- Reactors are producers which have a minimum fuel requirement based on their quantity and multiplier and produce steam
- If above this minimum, the steam production is amplified by the excess fuel
- Every reactor bought multiplies the multiplier of the reactor by 2Ã—

## Turbine

### Turbine Rotors
- A puzzle regarding the steam's expansion and ideality
- At each "slice" of the turbine, the expansion of the steam is affected by the rotor's expansion coefficient
- The ideal expansion for each "slice" is dependent on the progress through the turbine
- The ideal expansion at the end of the turbine is 8, lower and higher expansions are punished
- For each "slice" of the turbine, the velocity of the steam is also affected by the rotor's velocity coefficient
- The velocity of the steam directly affects energy production in that "slice"

### Dynamo Coils
- Each dynamo coil has an efficiency and a placement rule
- The efficiency of the coil affects the overall efficiency of the turbine
- The placement rule decides where a coil must be placed to be considered active
- The more efficient your coil layout, the faster the game progresses, however it is often difficult to find optimal layouts with as many high efficiency coils as possible
- Coil connectors act as rotor bearings for magnesium and lithium coils

## Nucleosynthesis
- Nucleosynthesis is the first prestige layer
- It resets all your mines, reactors and turbine blades
- For the first 4 of this layer, you also unlock a new mine and reactor
- The first nucleosynthesis unlocks dynamo coils while later ones unlock more efficient coils
- Based on the amount of nucleosyntheses you currently have, you start with more turbine rotors after each nucleosynthesis

## Nanite Research
- Nanite Research is the second prestige layer
- It resets all mines, reactors, turbine blades and dynamo coils
- You gain nanites based on the number of Cf-251 Reactors you currently have
- Nanites are only gained if you have more Cf-251 Reactors than the last nanite research
- These nanites can be used for various upgrades to improve your production

## Meltdown
- Meltdown is the third and final prestige layer
- You are able to meltdown upon reaching 2^1024 energy
- Meltdown rewards you with corium which can be used for meltdown upgrades
