# Fission Simulator
Fission Simulator is an incremental game made with HTML5, CSS3, JS and JSX. It is a game about Nuclear Physics and various nuclear processes. As such, it aims to be complex while approachable so that many can enjoy it while also appreciating the beauty of nuclear physics.
There are many types of fission and fusion reactors which this game spreads awareness of. Some parts of this game are based in reality while others are not, for the purpose of engaging players. Currently, the game is in development and we are looking for testers to help balance it.
