# Compiling

## Steps
1. Open the javascripts in a text editor of your choice
2. Make changes and edits in the `javascripts/react/dev` folder (**Note: Do not edit files in the `javascripts/react/dist` folder**)
3. Save all edited files

## Compilation
1. Run `compile.bat` or `compile.sh` which are located at the same directory as this guide
2. Ensure there are no errors in compilation (Fix errors if needed)
3. Test out your edited version of the scripts by opening `index.html` in your browser

## Terminal/Shell Command
Run this command in Command Prompt/Powershell(Windows) or Terminal(Mac/Linux) for compilation. This command should be run from the `Fission-Simulator` directory.
```shell
npm run compile-jsx
```
